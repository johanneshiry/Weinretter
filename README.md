We love wine. And we all have our little favourite place in the neighbourhood where we
enjoy drinking our wine best. But because of CoVid-19 they are closed now and we sit in 
solidarity self-isolation on our couches - without our favourite wine.

We want to change that: To avoid having to give up our wine and our favourite pubs,
we have come together as "Wine Saviours": We bring the stocks of restaurateurs into 
the living rooms at home - and with that a little financial support into the pockets 
of the restaurateurs in these difficult times.
We very much hope that after the Corona crisis all our favourite restaurants will open
their doors again and until then we are happy to support them sip by sip, glass by glass 
and bottle by bottle.

## Project Background 

During the [#WirVsVirusHackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/) of the Federal Government of Germany, 
we launched the website [www.weinretter.de](www.weinretter.de), where restaurateurs can offer 
their stocks of wine (and other goods) by registering with the name and 
address of the premises, the products for sale and their contact details. 
Consumers can use an interactive map to get an overview of the registered 
restaurants that wish to sell their wine - either for delivery or collection - and order directly.

We also introduce the team, participating restaurants and interesting 
facts on our newly launched Instagram channel [@weinretter_de](https://www.instagram.com/weinretter_de/).
Many of us would like to support our favourite pub or the little Italian 
on the corner in these difficult times and this is our chance to do so.
