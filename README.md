We love wine. And we all have little favourite places in our neighbourhood or 
neighbourhood where we like to drink our wine best. But because of CoVid-19 they 
had to close now and we sit in solidarity self-isolation on our couches - without 
our favourite wine.

We want to change that: To avoid having to give up our wine and our favourite pubs,
we have come together as "Wine Saviours": We bring the stocks of restaurateurs into 
the living rooms at home - and with that a little financial support into the account 
of the restaurateurs in these difficult times.
We very much hope that after the Corona crisis all our favourite restaurants will open
their doors again and on the way we are happy to support them sip by sip, glass by glass 
and bottle by bottle.

## Project Background 

During the [#WirVsVirusHackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/) of the Federal Government in Germany, 
we launched the website [www.weinretter.de](www.weinretter.de), where restaurateurs can offer 
their stocks of wine (and other goods) by registering with the name and 
address of the premises, the products for sale and their contact details. 
Consumers can use an interactive map to get an overview of the registered 
restaurants that wish to sell their wine - either for delivery or collection - and order directly.

We also introduce the team, participating restaurants and interesting 
facts about our also newly launched Instagram channel [@weinretter_de](https://www.instagram.com/weinretter_de/).
Many of us would like to support our favourite pub or the little Italian 
on the corner in these difficult times and this is our chance to do so.
